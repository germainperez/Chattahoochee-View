# Chattahoochee-View

## Chattahoochee View v1.0

Chattahoochee View is a web application that permits 360° viewing of panorama images from points along the Chattahoochee River.

A map shows the position of the panorama and a clickable route in red. Clicking on the red route will change the position of the panorama. The map also shows points of interest (landings) with relevant information.

A 360° video shows a high-definition timelapse sequence of the panoramas through the route.

High-speed internet connection recommended
